        <h3>Lemony Greek Chicken Soup Made Simple</h3>
        <p>This Greek Lemon Chicken Soup is cozy, healthy, and loaded with Greek 
            flavors like garlic, earthy olive oil, and feta cheese. The little orbs 
            of pearl couscous and morsels of cheese swirl to the surface with every 
            spoonful. A sight that lifts the spirit and warms the belly.

            This is the kind of chicken soup recipe I make my kids when they come 
            home worn from a long day at school. Sometimes their stories are filled 
            with joy and excitement. Some days they are teary recollections 
            insecurity and defeat.
