        <h3>Hearty Lentil Fesenjān (Pomegranate Walnut Stew)</h3>
        <p>We’ve been big fans of Fesenjān for years now—ever since John’s aunt 
            introduced us to it at a Persian restaurant in San Diego. Traditionally 
            prepared for special occasions, Fesenjān is perfect for colder months. 
            It’s hearty, comforting, savory-sweet, and so simple to make. Let us 
            show you how!
        </p>

            9-ingredient vegan Fesenjān made with lentils! A hearty stew of toasted 
            walnuts, pomegranate molasses, onion, and spices. A comforting, 
            Persian-inspired, plant-based meal!
